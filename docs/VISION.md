# Vision: MCP SuperAssistant

## The Ultimate Goal
To create the definitive bridge between the local computing environment and the cloud-based AI revolution. MCP SuperAssistant transforms static AI chat interfaces into dynamic, agentic command centers capable of interacting with your files, databases, and local tools securely and seamlessly.

## Core Philosophy
1.  **Agentic by Design**: We are moving beyond simple "chat". The Assistant should be able to execute multi-step workflows (Macros), make decisions based on outputs (Conditional Logic), and automate repetitive tasks without constant supervision.
2.  **Privacy First**: Your data stays local. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) ensures that only the necessary information is shared with the AI, and only when you explicitly allow it.
3.  **Universal Compatibility**: Works with ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and any other web-based LLM interface. One extension, infinite possibilities.
4.  **Insanely Great UX**: Power tools shouldn't look like command lines. We strive for a polished, intuitive, and beautiful interface (Sidebar, Dashboard, Toasts) that delights the user.

## Strategic Pillars

### 1. The Bridge (Core)
The connection between the browser and the local MCP Proxy must be rock-solid. We support SSE, WebSocket, and Streamable HTTP. Auto-reconnection and health monitoring are non-negotiable.

### 2. The brain (Logic)
The "Agentic Mode" allows users to define logic: "If tool A fails, try tool B, else send email." This transforms the tool from a passive utility to an active assistant.

### 3. The Memory (Context)
The Context Manager allows the AI to "remember" project details, style guides, and user preferences across different sessions and platforms.

## Future Horizons
*   **Cloud Sync**: Sync your macros and settings across devices (encrypted).
*   **Community Registry**: A marketplace for shared Macros and Tool configurations.
*   **Multi-Modal**: Better support for image/audio inputs and outputs (Voice Input is just the start).

## Success Metrics
*   User can automate a 5-step workflow with a single click.
*   Zero configuration required for standard MCP servers.
*   "It just works" reliability.
